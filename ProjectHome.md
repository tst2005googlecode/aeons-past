Aeons Past (working title) is a game based on an old TBS called Master of Magic. You pick a race such as humans or elves or whatever and lead it to victory by employing a party of heroes with which you crush the opposition. To do so you do things such as build cities that provide the heroes with troops and equipment, research spells that the heroes can use and train them so that they strengthen they abilities. In that way it differs from true 4X games, which are more complex and have more different ways to affect the game, with heroes being pretty much the main focus of this game.

**Current software requirements:**

Lua itself - duh. I'm using 5.1. If you're using windows, you can get a neat installer of it, LuaSocket library and a bunch of other stuff at http://code.google.com/p/luaforwindows/. Otherwise, http://www.lua.org/ is the official site.

Love2D - you can get it at https://love2d.org/

LuaSocket library - used for networking. http://luaforge.net/projects/luasocket/
